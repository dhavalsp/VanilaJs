# VanilaJS (ES6)
Here, I have created topics from ES6 new features. I also assume you have basic knowledge of the JavaScript. 
1.	CH_3 contain the node.js dependency. You need to have npm installed in your system. You can search in google install npm. You will find the steps.
2.	I have used VS code as editor. You can choose your editor. 
3.	To run CH_3, first run npm install from your cmd. 
4.	You can run any folder separately
5.	Set cmd path to your current folder
6.	Use “http-server -p 8085”
7.	Write in browser, localhost: 8085/pagename.html
8.	You can fork, download as zip, clone to this repository. 
9.	Every topic has its html page and script tag with babel JS to support the Older browser. 
10.	I would recommend to use the updated modern browser. 

This is my first tutorial on GitHub. So, any input/ feedback from you. I appreciate it. 

Keep smile. Keep Green. Keep Earth
